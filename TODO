1. UPDATE ENVIRONEMENT
	At the start of the shell, we should update at least two variables:
	- SHLVL: Must be incremented by 1. If it's not a number, it is set to 0.
	- SHELL: Should be set to the path of the minishell executable.

2. EXTENSIVE TESTING
	- Look for bugs, crashs, unhandled errors.
	- Look for leaks, double-free, conditional jump on unintialized values...

3. ERROR MANAGEMENT
	- Check if all allocations are protected.
	- Check if all error case are managed (ESPECIALLY IN BINARIES EXECUTION)
